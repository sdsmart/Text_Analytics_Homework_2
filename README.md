About This Repository
=====================
This homework was assigned to me in my Text Analytics class at the University of Oklahoma.

The description of the project can be found in the DOCX file included in the repository.

The edit_distance.py script includes a function that implements the dynamic calculation of the
"edit distance" between two strings.

Run Instructions
----------------
This program is just a function, you can include the file in other files in order to calculate the edit
distance between two strings when needed.
