Edit Distance Function
----------------------
This is a simple project containing a python function to perform the edit distance between two strings.
This link provides more information on the algorithm: [Edit Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance)

The edit_distance.py script includes a dynamic implementation of the algorithm described in the link above.

### Run Instructions
This project is just a single function.
You can include the edit_distance.py file in other programs in order to calculate the edit distance between two strings when needed.
